.SH NAME
@updatedb_conf@ \- a configuration file for updatedb(8)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @updatedb_conf@
is a text file.
Blank lines are ignored.
A
.B #
character outside of a quoted string starts a comment
extending until end of line.

Other lines must be of the following form:
.RS
.I VARIABLE
.B =
\fB"\fIVALUE\fB"\fR
.RE

White space between tokens is ignored.
.I VARIABLE
is an alphanumeric string which does not start with a digit.
.I VALUE
can contain any character except for \fB\(dq\fR.
No escape mechanism is supported within
.I VALUE
and there is no way to write
.I VALUE
spanning more than one line.

Unknown
.I VARIABLE
values are considered an error.
The defined variables are:

.TP
\fBPRUNEFS\fR
A whitespace-separated list of file system types (as used in \fB/etc/mtab\fR)
which should not be scanned by
.BR updatedb (8).
The file system type matching is case-insensitive.  By default, no file system
types are skipped.

When scanning a file system is skipped,
all file systems mounted in the subtree are skipped too,
even if their type does not match any entry in \fBPRUNEFS\fR.

.TP
\fBPRUNEPATHS\fR
A whitespace-separated list of path names of directories which should not be
scanned by
.BR updatedb (8).
Each path name must be exactly in the form
in which the directory would be reported by
.BR locate (1).

By default, no paths are skipped.

.TP
\fBPRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS\FR
One of the strings \fB0\fR, \fBno\fR, \fB1\fR or \fByes\fR.
If
.B PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS
is \fB1\fR or \fByes\fR,
bind mounts are not scanned by
.BR updatedb (8).
All file systems mounted in the subtree of a bind mount are skipped as well,
even if they are not bind mounts.

By default, bind mounts are not skipped.

.SH NOTES
Unlike the traditional behavior of \fBPRUNEFS\fR and \fBPRUNEPATHS\fR,
which excludes the matched directory (or the root of a matched file system)
from the created database,
the matched directory is entered in the created database.
This allows e.g.
.B locate /tmp
to find the standard temporary directories even though their contents are
excluded from the database.

In some
.BR updatedb (8)
implementations \fBPRUNEPATHS\fR can be used to exclude non-directory files.
This is not the case in this implementation.

.B @updatedb_conf@
is a shell script in some implementations,
which allows much more flexibility in defining the variables.
Equivalent functionality can be achieved by using the command-line options
to
.BR updatedb (8).
